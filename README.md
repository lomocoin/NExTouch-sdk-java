# NExTouch Java SDK for Android and Desktop
> Forked from [status-keycard-java](https://github.com/status-im/status-keycard-java)

This SDK simplifies integration with the [NExTouch Applet](https://github.com/lomocoin/u2f-javacard/) in Android
and Desktop applications. In this SDK you find both the classes needed for generic communication with SmartCards as well
as classes specifically addressing the Keycard.

To get started, check the file ```demo-android/src/main/java/im/status/keycard/app/MainActivity.java``` which a simple
demo application showing how the SDK works and what you can do with it.

<!-- ## Usage
